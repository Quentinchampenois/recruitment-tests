# Open Source Politics recruitment tests

Hello, thank you for reading our tests. You probably are in contact with us to join the technical team at Open Source Politics !

## Aim of our recruitment tests

In order to evaluate current skills of the candidate, he / she is invited to investigate the different steps present.

These tests are not designed to take much time. Furthermore, candidate is free to pass the exercices he / she wants to do. It help us to evaluate hard skills related to the current job the candidate is applying to. However, remember that those steps are not eliminatory.

The purpose of these tests is to determine how you are approaching a situation.

We know that you probably are a student, so it is normal that you do not know everything. We would like to hear from you what you want to learn during your time working with us, and what we could provide you with.

We have designed various categories of tests so that everyone can feel confident, it is interesting to try several of them.


## Rules
* All tests are perfectly optional, pick one, two, or zero. We see them as a discussion, not a mandatory step.

## Tips

* **Try to maximise Git usage**  
  Since we really support free software and open source, we take care about sharing source of our works, mostly on Github. On these recruitment test, we would like to see a clear commit history, with well named commits. Please don't hesitate to commit changes even if it isn't fully functional.


* **Ask for help if needed**  
  The aim of this recruitment test is not to frustrate or to be long for candidate. If you are stuck on a level, asking for help is better !


* **Commit and then refactor**  
  Feel free to write code without shame at first, then refactor it after. We all write nasty code at first, it's perfectly normal.
