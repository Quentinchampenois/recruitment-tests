# Questions
**Instructions:** Answer the questions, be concise.

## What is an Object? 

    Answer -> An object, in programming sense, is an instanciation of a Class. It is unique and has memory representation. It has properties and attributes from the class it instanciate.

## Can you explain the difference between include and extend in Ruby?

    Answer -> Methods from module included becomes instanciation methods whereas methods from extended module become class methods 

## A real estate developer has constructed a more than 100-storey building in the heart of Manhattan. Several months after the inauguration, residents complain about slow elevators, what can the real estate developer do to solve this problem?

    Answer -> There is many options,
    First of all, it could be interesting to ask what means "slow elevators", is it speed which is too slow or is it many people use it  
    * he can contact the elevator agency to ask them solving the velocity issue or change it
    * Maybe there is security reasons which explain the elevator's velocity
    * He could imagine a way to gratificate people which uses stairs and not elevator, which frees the use of this one
    * An interesting option could be to ask directly to complainants what solution would they like to see

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer -> Testing is in general or in programming ?

    At the moment the project has to be in production, testing is a main part of project. The project will be more stable. It means that you need more time to push it in production but there will be less possibilities of bugs. The time, and so the money, spent to testing will be rentabilized in the future with the time which we could spent to debug and it allows to reduce the possibles exploits. In this case it allows to get code cleaner and more readable, so conventions are similarly and there is homogenity in project code.

    So what ever is the testing case, general or programming, in fact you spend money but you do not waste it. You have to see this one like an invest, which is quantified like knowledge, structuration, or other form.
     
## Set up a challenge for another candidate in order to test his/her abilities, explain your choice.
   
    Answer -> I think about an exercise quite funny that someone gave me. It make me think about the elevator question. You are a student or an employee, in your work building, you have an RFID card which record your arrival and your departure. 
     Find ways to skirt / "brain" this system. 
     All answers are possible in the case of it works, even if it's really hard to realize. Why this challenge, because answers can be programming or social engineering or whatever, so it involves to take a step back otherwise than with technologies.
