# Back-end recruitment tests

Hello, thank you for reading our tests ! You probably are in contact with us to join the Back-end development team.

Please do not hesitate to ask us if you are encountering any issue or if you are stuck on a level.

## Procedure

In order to evaluate current skills of the candidate, he / she is invited to investigate the different steps present.

These tests are not designed to take much time. Furthermore, candidate is free to pass the exercices he / she wants to do. It help us to evaluate hard skills related to the current job the candidate is applying to. However, remember that those steps are not eliminatory. 

### Questions

In the [questions folder](./questions) candidate will find a `README` file.

Please answer those questions.

### Ruby
In the [ruby folder](./ruby) candidate will find multiple directories with a README

### Rails
In the [rails folder](./rails) candidate will find multiple directories with a README. Since our main product Decidim is written with Ruby On Rails, we would like to see how candidate deals with this framework. 

### CTF

In the [CTF folder](./CTF), there is a README file containing questions. These challenges are interesting because we like to train on platforms like CodeWars, RootMe, OverTheWire, etc. Those challenges are funny, at least we hope so, and the objective is to train during this recruitment test rather than being under pressure.

For each exercice, a unit test is present. Please find more information in the dedicated folder.
